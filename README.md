# Generate TV Scripts
Generate fake TV scripts inspired from previous scripts using RNNs 

This project has been done as a part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)

## Project's objective
The objective of this project is to generate a fake TV script by using a known dataset called Seinfield. The generated script is based on the patterns that the RNN recognizes in the data.
